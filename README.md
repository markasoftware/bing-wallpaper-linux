# Bing picture of the day wallpaper for linux
An ultra-simple, ultra-small shell script that, when run, sets the wallpaper to the current bing picture of the day. 
Needs curl, feh, and xmllint (I think xmllint and curl are usually installed with linux? Not 100% sure). Run it on 
startup to keep your background up-to-date, or more often if you leave your computer on for more than a day at a time. 
Enjoy!
